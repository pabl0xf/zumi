    "In my opinion, it learned far better than expected. The fact that it seemed to confer additional state to a visually identical X and then track it's movement separate from others was quite surprising. \n",

    "It was interesting to see how it struggled to improve for the first few epochs. This seems to be near the limit of what this network can learn. As the weights are initializeded at random, this won't always succeed. If the accuracy doesn't improve over .3 then try training again.\n",

    "This is still quite a simplified version of this game. Since there are only 324 possible board sequences to the game, perhaps it has simply memorized each possiblity. Perhaps it would struggle with additional shuffles of the board. Perhaps they could be shuffled diagonally as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "###What tests could you devise to disambiguiate whether it had simply 'memorized' the world state?\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this only work with all the board states at once? Can this be made to accept any length of sequences with sliding window on the complete state?\n",
